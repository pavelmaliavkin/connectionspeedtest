### general
Task was done within 3 hours.

### documentation
I have never documented my code it means I definitely don't know how it should be formatted.

### fast.com
Unfortunately I didn't find any package that I can use for fast.com as well as I had understanding that within 3 hours I will not be able to create solution which will include my own fast.com integration and that is why decided to simply duplicate ookla provider two times, as in my opinion it is enough to show idea.

### tests
There are a lot of ways how to write tests and because I have no idea which 'standard' you expected, I used the simplest way.

### test coverage
I achieved the goal by 80.6% but in fact tests are not so good, because packages that were used doesn't allow to mock some data and in fact we have mix of unit and integration tests.
